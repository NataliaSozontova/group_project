                        Dubai Mall is the city's premier mall and one of the city's best places to visit for a day of shopping and indoor activities to keep the kids busy. 
                        It provides entry to the Burj Khalifa, as well as the Dubai Aquarium. There is also an ice-skating rink, gaming zone, and cinema complex if you're 
                        looking for more entertainment options. The shopping and eating is endless, and there are nearly always special events such as live music and fashion 
                        shows within the mall. The most famous of these are the annual Dubai Shopping Festival in January and February and the Dubai Summer Surprises Festival
                         in July and August.

                        The Al Fahidi Quarter (previously known, and sometimes still referred to as the Bastakia neighborhood) was built in the late 19th century to be the home of wealthy Persian merchants
                        who dealt mainly in pearls and textiles and were lured to Dubai because of the tax-free trading and access to Dubai Creek. Wind-towers provided the homes here with an early form of air conditioning 
                        the wind trapped in the towers was funneled down into the houses. Persian merchants likely transplanted this architectural element (common in Iranian coastal houses) from their home country to the Gulf.

                        One of the city's top tourist attractions, the Dubai Aquarium houses 140 species of sea life in the huge suspended tank on the ground floor of the Dubai Mall.
                        As well as free viewing from the mall, if you enter the Underwater Zoo, you can walk through the aquarium tunnels.
                        Different activities help you get a closer look at the sea life. Glass bottom boat tours (on top of the tank) are particularly popular.

                        The beach has excellent facilities, with plenty of sun loungers, restaurants, and water sports operators offering jet skiing.
                        While in the area, brush off the sand for an hour and visit the Majlis Ghorfat Um Al-Sheef, just a short hop from the beach. 
                        Built in 1955, this was the summer residence of the late Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed al-Maktoum. The residence, made out of gypsum 
                        and coral-block, has been restored and maintains much of the original beautiful decor, giving you a better understanding of the 
                        opulent lifestyle of Dubai's rulers.

                        host of smaller gallery start-ups have also moved in. The district's program of rotating collections focuses both on the work of major
                        artists, as well as highlighting new Middle Eastern talent. This emerging district is also the place to come for fashion and accessory 
                        boutiques by local designers, pop-up restaurants, and café life, and it showcases the energetic and youthful buzz of a city, which is 
                        usually more noted for its corporate face.
